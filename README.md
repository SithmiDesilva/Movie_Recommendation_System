# 🎬 Emotion-Based Movie Recommendation System 🎭  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies based on the user's emotion. It uses **web scraping** to fetch real-time movie recommendations from **IMDb**, ensuring that users get updated and relevant movie suggestions.  

## 🌟 Features  
✔️ **Emotion-Based Recommendations** – Get movie suggestions based on your mood.  
✔️ **Real-Time Data** – Fetches the latest movie titles from IMDb dynamically.  
✔️ **User-Friendly Web Interface** – Simple and interactive UI built with Flask.  
✔️ **Fast & Lightweight** – Uses Python libraries for efficient scraping and rendering.  
✔️ **Scalable & Flexible** – Can be extended with AI-based personalized recommendations.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
🔹 **Python** – Core programming language  
🔹 **Flask** – Web framework for backend  
🔹 **BeautifulSoup** – Web scraping IMDb movie lists  
🔹 **Requests** – Fetching IMDb webpage data  
🔹 **HTML & CSS** – For the frontend interface  
🔹 **Flask-CORS** – Handling cross-origin requests  

## 📌 How It Works  
1. The user selects an **emotion** (e.g., Excitement, Passion, Adventure, Thriller, etc.).  
2. The system maps the emotion to a **corresponding IMDb movie genre**.  
3. **Web scraping** (via `BeautifulSoup`) fetches the top 20 movie titles from IMDb.  
4. The recommended movies are displayed as a list.
